# Bot Arena Auth And Provisioning

Release status (aligned 2026-09-04): the same-repository smoke-bot flow has passed end
to end. Fork PRs now persist as `pending_invite_review`; a maintainer-only
base-branch workflow binds the approver's immutable GitHub identity and exact
head SHA before automatically dispatching trusted provisioning. The path is
verified through the completed external-account Noodle admission/onboarding
test and July 22-23 fixes. Recorded-game requirements remain separate;
open/self-service intake remains later.
Track implementation in
[`BOT_ARENA_INVITE_PREVIEW_SPRINT.md`](../BOT_ARENA_INVITE_PREVIEW_SPRINT.md)
and the release gates in
[`BOT_ARENA_RELEASE_READINESS.md`](../BOT_ARENA_RELEASE_READINESS.md).

## Purpose

This document fixes the target authentication and provisioning model for public
Bot Arena participation. It covers the normal user path, operator path, CI path,
OpenBao secret path, and the pre-merge gates around bot acceptance.

The core rule is separation of responsibility:

- GitHub proves human identity.
- Reef Admin DB owns local users, roles, trust state, and audit records; Arena
  owns bot ownership/entitlements and admission state.
- Reef Admin API mediates durable control-plane operations.
- OpenBao stores bot and service secrets.
- Runtime services read OpenBao through service credentials, not through user
  credentials.

## Actors

### Participant

A participant is a GitHub-authenticated user who can submit bots, own accepted
bots, edit their bot config through the admin app, and view their own results.

Participants do not normally log into OpenBao. The admin app is the participant
secret/config surface.

### Reviewer

A reviewer can inspect bot submissions and approve PRs. A reviewer role can be
seeded from GitHub repository access, but Reef roles are the final authorization
source.

### Operator

An operator can manage runs, game settings, user trust state, bot enablement,
and operational recovery.

### Secret Admin

A secret admin can perform sensitive OpenBao-backed actions such as manual
secret repair or rotation. This role must be explicit in Reef and must not be
granted only because a user has GitHub repository write access.

### Platform Admin

A platform admin is a break-glass role for full control-plane administration.
GitHub repository owner/admin status can seed this role during bootstrap, but
Reef authorization owns the continuing assignment.

## Identity Model

GitHub is the first human identity provider because a GitHub account is already
required to submit bots through pull requests.

Reef must key users by GitHub's immutable numeric user id, not by username or
email. GitHub login and email are display/contact attributes only and may
change.

Minimum user fields:

```text
reef_user_id
github_user_id
github_login
display_name
trust_state
created_at
last_seen_at
```

Initial Admin DB tables:

```text
admin.users
admin.roles
admin.user_roles
admin.audit_events
admin.oauth_states
admin.sessions
admin.service_tokens
```

Arena ownership table:

```text
arena.user_bot_ownerships
```

The control plane joins Arena ownership with the Admin identity record only at
the Arena adapter. Reef-only deployments never require these tables. This is a
pre-release cutover: `admin/0004_remove_legacy_arena_entitlements.sql` removes
the superseded Admin tables after the Arena migration has created their owned
replacements. Do not alter the applied Admin migration in place.

OAuth states, browser session tokens, and service tokens must be stored as
server-side hashes only. Raw token values are returned once at issue time and
must not be persisted in Admin DB audit records or logs.

Trust states:

```text
new
trusted
limited
banned
```

Trust state rules:

- `new` is assigned automatically on first GitHub OAuth login. New users can
  sign in, view their account and linked bots, and prepare owner-managed config,
  but their bots are not run-eligible.
- `trusted` is required for bot run eligibility.
- `limited` is an operator-applied safety restriction. Limited users can view
  public pages and their own bot status, but cannot write bot config, submit or
  activate new bot versions, or become run-eligible.
- `banned` blocks Bot Arena participation, bot config management, provisioning,
  and run eligibility.

Only `operator` or `platform-admin` can move users among `new`, `trusted`, and
`limited`. Only `platform-admin` can apply or remove `banned`. Every trust-state
change requires a reason and an Admin DB audit event.

Accepted bot code still passes through a human review gate.

## Role Model

Reef roles are the source of truth. GitHub repository role can seed role
assignment at login or during bootstrap, but local roles are what the Admin API
enforces.

Suggested seed mapping:

```text
GitHub repo owner/admin       -> platform-admin candidate
GitHub repo maintainer/admin  -> operator/reviewer candidate
GitHub collaborator with write -> reviewer candidate
normal GitHub user            -> participant
```

Baseline Reef roles:

```text
participant
reviewer
operator
secret-admin
platform-admin
```

Role assignment rules:

- `participant` is assigned automatically on first GitHub OAuth login.
- `reviewer` can be assigned by `operator` or `platform-admin`.
- `operator`, `secret-admin`, and `platform-admin` can be assigned only by
  `platform-admin`.
- `platform-admin` is a bootstrap or break-glass role, not a normal
  GitHub-repository-role sync.
- Role assignment and removal require a reason and an Admin DB audit event.

The backend role ids above are the source-of-truth values. The web app may map
older or friendlier display labels for presentation, but authorization decisions
must use the canonical backend ids. For Bot Arena browser sessions, `operator`
implies arena game/run administration and `platform-admin` implies all operator
capabilities.

## Communication Channels

### User Facing

```text
user -> web admin app
user -> GitHub PR/review flow
user or bot -> /api/v1 trading API
operator -> OpenBao UI/CLI, usually through SSH tunnel
```

Normal participants should not need direct OpenBao access. Direct OpenBao login
is an operator escape hatch.

### Service To Service

```text
CI -> Admin API
Admin API -> OpenBao
platform-runtime -> OpenBao
simulator/run-plane -> OpenBao
simulator/run-plane -> Admin API
run-plane export/cleanup -> Analytics/Admin API
Admin API -> Admin DB
Admin API -> Analytics DB
platform-runtime -> Runtime DB
platform-runtime -> matching-engine
```

### Admin And Ops

```text
operator -> SSH tunnel -> Admin API
operator -> SSH tunnel -> OpenBao
operator -> deploy scripts -> backbone host
backup job -> Postgres/OpenBao -> R2
```

### Future GitHub Automation

GitHub App support is deferred for MVP. If it is added later, it should own
webhooks, check runs, PR comments, and installation-token based repository
automation.

Until then, GitHub Actions and `GITHUB_TOKEN` can post statuses/comments, while
CI authenticates to the Admin API through the existing scoped token and later
through GitHub Actions OIDC.

## Auth By Channel

```text
user -> web admin app: GitHub OAuth session
participant -> OpenBao: not a normal product path
operator -> OpenBao: OIDC or SSH tunnel plus manual/admin token during early ops
CI -> Admin API: scoped bearer token first, GitHub Actions OIDC later
Admin API -> OpenBao: server-side OpenBao client flow
platform-runtime -> OpenBao: AppRole
simulator -> OpenBao: AppRole
run-plane -> Admin/Analytics API: scoped bearer token first, workload identity later
operator -> host: SSH key
backup -> R2: R2 access key scoped to backup bucket
```

## Admin HTTP Auth Boundary

The platform runtime exposes the first admin auth HTTP boundary when
`PLATFORM_ADMIN_AUTH_ENABLED=true`.

Required environment:

```text
PLATFORM_ADMIN_AUTH_ENABLED=true
ADMIN_POSTGRES_JDBC_URL or RUNTIME_POSTGRES_JDBC_URL
ADMIN_POSTGRES_USER or RUNTIME_POSTGRES_USER
ADMIN_POSTGRES_PASSWORD or RUNTIME_POSTGRES_PASSWORD
GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID
GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET
GITHUB_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI
```

Optional environment:

```text
ADMIN_SESSION_COOKIE_NAME=reef_admin_session
ADMIN_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true
```

`GITHUB_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` must be HTTPS, except `http://localhost...` is
allowed for local development. Local browser development over plain HTTP should
set `ADMIN_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=false`; hosted environments should keep secure
cookies enabled.

Browser routes:

```text
GET  /admin/auth/github/start?redirectPath=/admin
GET  /admin/auth/github/callback
GET  /admin/auth/session
POST /admin/auth/logout
```

The GitHub callback consumes the one-time OAuth state, upserts the GitHub-backed
Reef user, issues a server-side session, and sets the admin session cookie. Raw
session tokens and OAuth state tokens are stored as hashes only.

Admin API gateway routes now accept either the admin session cookie or a scoped
server-side service token. Scoped service token families are route-specific:

```text
/admin/v1/arena/bots                    -> ci, admin
/admin/v1/arena/bots/openbao-provision  -> ci, admin
/admin/v1/arena/bots/config             -> admin
/admin/v1/arena/bot-versions            -> ci, admin
/admin/v1/arena/admission-windows       -> ci, admin
/admin/v1/arena/eligibility-decisions   -> ci, admin
/admin/v1/arena/roster-previews         -> ci, admin
/admin/v1/arena/rosters                 -> ci, admin
/admin/v1/arena/roster-removals         -> ci, admin
GET /admin/v1/access/users              -> admin
GET /admin/v1/access/roles              -> admin
POST /admin/v1/access/users/trust-state -> admin
POST /admin/v1/access/users/roles       -> admin
POST /admin/v1/access/users/roles/revoke -> admin
GET /admin/v1/arena/runs                -> ci, admin
GET /admin/v1/arena/run-bot-results     -> ci, admin
GET /admin/v1/arena/run-enforcement-events -> ci, admin
GET /admin/v1/arena/leaderboard         -> ci, admin
/admin/v1/analytics/run-exports         -> sim, admin
/admin/v1/analytics/run-bot-summaries   -> sim, admin
/admin/v1/risk/account-controls         -> admin
/admin/v1/risk/circuit-breakers         -> admin
/admin/v1/risk/price-collars            -> admin
/admin/v1/settlement/facts              -> admin
/admin/v1/settlement/repairs/cash       -> admin
/admin/v1/settlement/repairs/security   -> admin
/admin/v1/settlement/force-settle       -> admin
/admin/v1/settlement/reverse-ledger-entry -> admin
/admin/v1/settlement/obligations/materialize -> admin
```

Access-management browser sessions require a trusted Admin DB `operator` or
`platform-admin`. The `/admin/access` page lists Admin DB users, roles, trust
state, and bot ownerships, then writes trust-state and role mutations through the
routes above. The gateway performs the coarse operator/platform-admin session
check; `AdminIdentityService` applies the finer policy: operators may assign or
revoke `reviewer` and move users among `new`, `trusted`, and `limited`, while
`platform-admin` is required for `operator`, `secret-admin`, `platform-admin`,
`participant`, and `banned` changes. Every mutation requires a reason and is
written to `admin.audit_events`.

The existing static bearer-token environment variables remain as compatibility
fallbacks:

```text
ARENA_ADMIN_API_TOKEN
ANALYTICS_EXPORT_API_TOKEN
ADMIN_API_TOKEN
ARENA_ADMIN_API_ACTOR_ID
ANALYTICS_EXPORT_API_ACTOR_ID
ADMIN_API_ACTOR_ID
```

Bot-submission provisioning uses the scoped `ci` token path from the trusted
`Bot Submission Provision` `workflow_run` workflow. The pull-request workflow
that checks out submitted bot code does not receive these secrets or OIDC token
minting permission:

```text
ARENA_ADMIN_API_URL
ARENA_ADMIN_API_TOKEN
BOT_SUBMISSION_OPENBAO_MODE=real
ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL
ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN
```

The separate `Bot Submission Invite Approval` workflow uses
`ADMIN_API_TOKEN` for
`/admin/v1/arena/submission-admissions/approve`. Approval is an admin-family
operation because it authorizes an exact fork head SHA; the admission-recording
and provisioning routes continue to use the narrower `ARENA_ADMIN_API_TOKEN`.
Both credentials remain confined to trusted default-branch workflows.

After merge, the registry sync resolves fork bot ownership from the exact
approved submission admission (repository, pull request number, reviewed head
SHA, bot id, and immutable GitHub user identity). The manifest's
`metadata.publisher` remains a free-form display label and is not treated as a
GitHub login for approved fork submissions. Trusted same-repository bots retain
the legacy publisher-login fallback when no fork admission applies. The sync
also sends the trusted PR submitter id and login alongside the admission
reference so ownership assignment remains compatible while the control-plane
handler rolls out.

Current hosted value:

```text
ARENA_ADMIN_API_URL=https://reef-arena-admin.shrimpworks.dev
```

Keep this as configuration only. `shrimpworks.dev` is the current Cloudflare
zone for development projects, not a permanent product domain; moving to a new
domain should require changing Cloudflare DNS, backbone Caddy `API_DOMAIN`, and
the GitHub `ARENA_ADMIN_API_URL` secret, not changing code.

`ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL` and `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN` are supplied
by GitHub Actions when the workflow grants `id-token: write`. Local developer
checks should leave `BOT_SUBMISSION_OPENBAO_MODE` unset or set it to `dry-run`;
real local calls must explicitly set `BOT_SUBMISSION_OPENBAO_MODE=real` and may
provide `GITHUB_OIDC_TOKEN` when not running inside GitHub Actions. The default
GitHub OIDC audience requested by the provisioner is `reef-bot-submission-ci`,
matching the OpenBao `auth/jwt/role/reef-bot-submission-ci` bound audience seeded
by `infra/hetzner-core/server/scripts/configure-openbao.sh`.

The hosted Admin API does not trust the request body alone for the OpenBao path.
For direct `/admin/v1/arena/bots/openbao-provision` calls,
`submitterIdentity` must exactly match the GitHub Actions OIDC `actor` claim
before any OpenBao write/delete is attempted. An approved fork is the only
delegated case: the OIDC actor may be the maintainer who dispatched the trusted
base-branch workflow, but the API requires a persisted `invite_approved`
admission matching the OIDC repository, PR number, exact reviewed head SHA,
bot id, fork owner, and submitter login before writing the fork owner's secret
slice. A changed SHA or identity mismatch fails closed. If the target bot
already has ownership metadata, the approved submitter must also be an active
owner or maintainer.

When the Admin DB auth layer is configured, authenticated session and service
tokens bind the internal admin actor id from the trusted token record instead of
from caller-controlled headers. Static fallback tokens also bind the internal
admin actor server-side from `ARENA_ADMIN_API_ACTOR_ID`,
`ANALYTICS_EXPORT_API_ACTOR_ID`, or `ADMIN_API_ACTOR_ID`, falling back to
`ADMIN_ACTOR_ID` when a family-specific actor is not configured. They do not
trust `X-Reef-Actor-Id` from the caller.

## Participant Bot Config

Accepted bots use a bot-scoped OpenBao slice:

```text
secret/bots/<submitter-identity>/<bot-id>
```

Participants manage that slice through the Admin app's bot config panel. The
browser talks only to `/admin/v1/arena/bots/config`; it never receives an
OpenBao token. The API returns saved config values only after the same
owner-scoped authorization used for bot config edits, so another participant
cannot read a different bot owner's config.

Supported operations:

```text
GET    /admin/v1/arena/bots/config?botId=<bot-id>
PUT    /admin/v1/arena/bots/config
DELETE /admin/v1/arena/bots/config?botId=<bot-id>
```

The `PUT` body is:

```json
{
  "botId": "sample-bot",
  "config": {
    "apiKey": "stored-in-openbao",
    "riskLimit": 1000
  }
}
```

The Admin API validates that `config` is a JSON object, caps the serialized
payload at 65 KiB, allows at most 128 top-level keys, and requires each
top-level key to match `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]{1,64}`. Values may be arbitrary JSON so
bot authors are not forced into a fixed schema. Runtime descriptor preflight
still resolves only scalar string/number/boolean keys.

OpenBao stores the object as one opaque `config_json` string field plus metadata
(`config_schema`, `config_sha256`, `updated_at`, `updated_by`). This keeps the
participant-facing blob flexible and avoids returning or audit-recording secret
values through Reef. Reef Admin audit records for replace/delete include only
the bot id, OpenBao path, and key count/path metadata.

Authorization:

- the bot owner or maintainer can manage that bot's config unless banned
- `limited` users cannot write bot config
- operators/admins must not view or edit another user's bot config values
- `secret-admin` and `platform-admin` may clear or purge bot config through a
  separate audited repair path with a reason; `operator` may clear config only
  where an explicit operator-recovery action exists
- `/admin/v1/arena/bots/config` accepts only admin-family service tokens on the
  service-token path

Normal owner config updates do not require a user-entered reason. Reef audit
records still include actor, bot id, OpenBao path metadata, key count, timestamp,
and correlation id, and must never include secret values.

OpenBao access uses the dedicated `reef-platform-admin-bot-config` AppRole from
`infra/hetzner-core/server/scripts/configure-openbao.sh`. The runtime must have
these env vars in `/opt/reef/secrets/platform-runtime.env`:

```text
BAO_BOT_CONFIG_ROLE_ID=...
BAO_BOT_CONFIG_SECRET_ID=...
```

## Bot Submission Flow

### New Bot

```text
1. User signs into the admin app with GitHub.
2. User opens a bot-submission PR from a fork.
3. Untrusted CI validates manifest, static/security checks, sandbox behavior, and resource limits without hosted credentials.
4. Submission enters pending_invite_review; opening a PR does not imply admission or a place in the next game.
5. Maintainer approves the immutable GitHub user id, ownership intent, and reviewed head SHA.
6. A trusted base-branch workflow provisions or verifies the Reef user and OpenBao bot slice without executing fork code.
7. User enters required config in the admin app before merge; readiness records only descriptors and hashes, never secret values.
8. PR check confirms approval, SHA-bound checks, provisioning, and config readiness.
9. Maintainer merges the PR before the run-window cutoff.
10. Registry sync rebuilds from master, verifies source/artifact hashes, and records the accepted bot version.
11. The eligibility evaluator may add that immutable version to a future locked roster. Operators schedule and inspect windows through `/admin/v1/arena/admission-windows`, persist reason-coded results through `/admin/v1/arena/eligibility-decisions`, preview deterministic capacity ordering through `/admin/v1/arena/roster-previews`, lock/read the immutable hashed snapshot through `/admin/v1/arena/rosters`, and record a no-replacement emergency-removal overlay through `/admin/v1/arena/roster-removals`. The corresponding session-gated UI is `/admin/admission`.
```

OpenBao slice provisioning should happen before merge. Secret/config completeness
should gate run eligibility, not merge, because config values are user-managed
opaque data and should not be exposed to CI or reviewers.

The same-repository and external-account admission/onboarding flows are proven.
The fork-based trusted handoff is implemented: untrusted CI records pending
admission, maintainer approval is SHA-bound, and only the trusted base-branch
workflow can provision. Do not grant hosted credentials or OIDC permission to
the workflow that executes submitted code. Initial onboarding is complete;
remaining run-window/game evidence is tracked separately. Admission and run cutoffs are defined in
[`BOT_ARENA_INVITE_PREVIEW_SPRINT.md`](../BOT_ARENA_INVITE_PREVIEW_SPRINT.md).

### Existing Bot Update

```text
1. User opens PR for a new version of an owned bot.
2. CI validates the new version.
3. Human reviewer approves.
4. Admin API verifies owner, trust state, limits, and existing OpenBao slice.
5. PR merges.
6. New bot version becomes accepted.
```

Accepted users may have a faster review path, but follow-up versions still keep
a human gate unless an explicit future decision changes that policy.

### Removed Or Disabled Bot

Removal and disablement are separate concepts:

- disablement prevents future runs without deleting registry history or secrets
- removal is an explicit administrative action with stronger audit and secret
  lifecycle consequences

Secret deletion should not be automatic on ordinary code removal until the
retention and recovery policy is explicit.

## Ownership And Limits

A GitHub user may own multiple bots. No ownership-count limit is currently
enforced; add one only with an explicit policy and tested storage/API behavior.

Recommended config:

```text
MAX_BOTS_PER_USER
MAX_ACTIVE_BOTS_PER_USER
MAX_BOT_VERSION_SUBMISSIONS_PER_DAY
```

Bot versions are not lifetime-limited, but version submission rate should be
bounded to protect CI and review capacity.

Team-owned bots and ownership transfer are deferred. The registry should avoid
schema choices that make those impossible later.

## OpenBao Secret Model

OpenBao stores an opaque config blob per bot secret slice.

```text
secret/bots/<submitter-identity>/<bot-id>
```

The config blob is not versioned. Runtime loads the current blob when a run is
prepared, validates only the platform-known descriptor shape where declared,
and passes the data to the bot as `ctx.config`.

Bots own application-level parsing and validation of their config blob. Public
bot files must not contain secrets; anything committed in a bot file is public
by definition.

For replay and audit, run records should store metadata, not secret values:

```text
openbao_path
config_sha256
loaded_at
```

## Merge And Run Gates

Required before merge:

- bot manifest and contract checks pass
- sandbox/security/resource checks pass
- human reviewer approval exists
- user is not banned
- bot ownership and trust checks pass
- OpenBao slice exists or has been provisioned

The trusted provisioning workflow posts an idempotent PR comment when a fork
submission enters pending invite review, then updates the same comment after the
hosted OpenBao step. The pending state names the exact reviewed head SHA and
maintainer action without claiming that provisioning ran. The completed state
includes only non-secret metadata: bot ID, submitter identity, provisioning
flow, the OpenBao slice path, and the next user/operator action. It must never
include token values, GitHub OIDC tokens, OpenBao tokens, or bot secret data.
The slice path is an identifier, not a public URL. Normal participants use the
Reef Admin secret/config surface; direct OpenBao access is reserved for
`secret-admin`/operator workflows over a private SSH tunnel.

The same trusted workflow also publishes a `registry-diff-and-provision` commit
status on the PR head SHA. Branch protection should require that explicit
status context, plus the untrusted PR-side `validate-manifest` and
`scan-and-sandbox-test` checks, rather than requiring the trusted workflow-run
job name directly. Non-bot branches get a successful
`registry-diff-and-provision` status with no hosted Admin API call. Forked bot
submission branches remain pending until the SHA-bound invite approval triggers
trusted provisioning; a changed head SHA invalidates the approval.

Repository-wide CI still starts for every pull request so job-level check names
remain visible to branch protection. A trusted-base change-scope classifier may
skip the expensive general matrix only when the head branch matches
`bots/add|update|remove/<bot-id>` and every current and rename-source path is
under the exact `bots/<bot-id>/` directory. Empty, malformed, cross-bot, or
mixed-path changes fail closed to full CI. The untrusted Bot Submission workflow
enforces the same exact-directory rule and continues to run manifest validation,
approved-import scanning, and the container-isolated sandbox test. General
service, documentation, infrastructure, replay, schema, benchmark, and image
build jobs are not substitutes for those bot-specific security gates.

Live configuration (verified 2026-07-19): `master` requires
`registry-diff-and-provision` in addition to the untrusted submission checks.
Bot-specific human approval is enforced by the maintainer-only invite workflow
because GitHub's branch-level review count is not conditional on bot paths.

After merge, `.github/workflows/bot-registry-sync.yml` syncs changed
`bots/*/bot.json` manifests into the hosted arena registry. It registers the bot
metadata through `/admin/v1/arena/bots`, builds the hosted artifact to derive the
source/artifact hashes, then registers the merged version through
`/admin/v1/arena/bot-versions`. This is deliberately post-merge: pre-merge CI
can provision the OpenBao slice and block review, while the durable registry only
records code that actually landed on `master`/`main`.

Required before run:

- bot version is accepted
- bot is enabled
- owner trust state is `trusted`
- owner is not `limited` or `banned`
- required config descriptors are resolvable
- config blob passes platform-known descriptor checks where declared
- simulation safety switches and runtime guardrails pass

## Failure Handling

PR feedback should classify failures by who can fix them.

User-fixable failures:

```text
manifest invalid
bot tests fail
sandbox/resource gate fails
config descriptor invalid
bot ownership or limit problem
```

Maintainer/platform failures:

```text
Admin API unavailable
OpenBao unavailable
OpenBao provisioning failed
CI cannot authenticate to Admin API
registry read/write failure
unexpected identity mismatch
```

Platform failures should post a PR comment with the failed subsystem, shortest
actionable error, and maintainer tag. The first implementation can tag the
primary maintainer; later this should move to a configured maintainer group.

## Audit Events

The control plane should append audit events for identity, review, provisioning,
secret, and run actions.

Initial event names:

```text
user.login
user.trust_state.updated
bot.created
bot.version.submitted
bot.version.approved
bot.openbao_slice.provisioned
bot.config.updated
bot.disabled
user.banned
run.started
run.finished
run.result.published
```

Audit records should include actor, subject, timestamp, correlation id, source,
and relevant object ids. Audit records must not contain secret values.

## MVP Decisions

- GitHub is the main human identity provider.
- GitHub OAuth is enough for the web admin app MVP.
- GitHub App is deferred.
- GitHub Actions plus a scoped Admin API token remain acceptable first.
- GitHub Actions OIDC is the preferred later replacement for CI-to-Admin API
  shared tokens.
- OpenBao remains mostly hidden from participants.
- AppRole remains the service-to-OpenBao auth method.
- OpenBao slice provisioning is a pre-merge requirement.
- Config completeness is a pre-run requirement.
- Reef roles and trust state are stored in the Admin DB and enforced by the
  Admin API.
- Browser-session authorization uses Admin DB roles and trust state as the
  source of truth. The older runtime role/permission binding remains available
  for CLI, local setup, service-token actors, and non-browser command paths, but
  GitHub-authenticated browser sessions must not require a duplicate
  `arena.admin` runtime binding.

## Open Follow-Ups

- ~~Implement Admin DB user, role, trust-state, ownership, and audit tables.~~
  Done: admin migrations `0003_admin_identity.sql` and
  `0004_admin_auth_sessions.sql` plus the Kotlin Postgres stores cover users,
  roles, trust state, limits, ownership, audit, OAuth state, sessions, and
  service tokens.
- ~~Add GitHub OAuth login to the admin app.~~ Done: `apps/arena-admin` has a
  working GitHub login, and Caddy now reverse-proxies `/admin/auth/*`,
  `/admin/v1/*`, and `/api/v1/*` same-origin with the static app (previously
  the browser-facing surface wasn't Caddy-exposed at all, only the CI
  bearer-token paths were).
- ~~Bridge the two disconnected admin identity/permission systems for Bot Arena
  browser sessions.~~ Done: trusted Admin DB `operator` and `platform-admin`
  users satisfy `arena.admin` for GitHub-authenticated browser requests without
  a duplicate runtime role binding. Runtime role bindings remain for CLI,
  service-token actors, and non-browser command paths.
- Run the local arena-admin auth smoke with real Admin DB auth, not fixture mode.
  `platform-api` must run with:

  ```text
  REEF_ENV=local
  PLATFORM_ADMIN_AUTH_ENABLED=true
  ADMIN_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=false
  ADMIN_POSTGRES_JDBC_URL=<optional; defaults to RUNTIME_POSTGRES_JDBC_URL>
  ADMIN_POSTGRES_USER=<optional; defaults to RUNTIME_POSTGRES_USER>
  ADMIN_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<optional; defaults to RUNTIME_POSTGRES_PASSWORD>
  GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<local GitHub OAuth app client id>
  GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<local GitHub OAuth app secret>
  GITHUB_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080/admin/auth/github/callback
  LOCAL_DEV_ADMIN_UI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5174
  ```

  `LOCAL_DEV_ADMIN_UI_BASE_URL` is ignored unless `REEF_ENV=local`. It keeps
  `redirectPath` relative and allowlisted while sending the browser back to the
  Vite admin UI after GitHub sets the platform session cookie.

  Keep these disabled for the live auth smoke:

  ```text
  LOCAL_DEV_ADMIN_AUTH_BYPASS=false
  PUBLIC_ARENA_LOCAL_DEV_FAKE_ADMIN=false
  PUBLIC_ARENA_LOCAL_DEV_FIXTURES=false
  ```

  Test flow:

  1. Restart platform-api with the auth environment above and Admin DB access.
  2. Open http://localhost:5174/admin and complete GitHub OAuth once.
  3. Seed that existing Admin DB user:
     REEF_ENV=local make dev-admin-auth-local-seed ARGS="--github-login=<login> --role=operator"
  4. Seed a local owned bot for the real owner-scoped `/bot-admin` page:
     REEF_ENV=local make dev-admin-owned-bot-local-seed ARGS="--github-login=<login>"
  5. Run:
     make dev-smoke-admin-auth-local
  6. Start arena-admin without fixture flags and open /admin, /admin/access, and /bot-admin.
  ```

  `scripts/dev/admin-auth-local-seed.mjs` refuses to run unless an explicit
  local/dev/test profile is set and talks only to the local Docker Compose
  Postgres service. `scripts/dev/admin-owned-bot-local-seed.mjs` has the same
  local-profile guard and writes one demo arena bot plus the Admin DB ownership
  row for the selected GitHub-backed user. `scripts/dev/arena-admin-auth-local-smoke.mjs`
  fails if `LOCAL_DEV_ADMIN_AUTH_BYPASS` or the public arena-admin fixture flags
  are enabled.
  The expected final evidence is a browser pass with no console errors plus
  successful GETs for `/admin/v1/arena/bots`, `/admin/v1/arena/runs`,
  `/admin/v1/arena/run-bot-results`,
  `/admin/v1/arena/run-enforcement-events`, and
  `/admin/v1/arena/leaderboard` using the GitHub session cookie.
- The main local Compose stack does not start OpenBao. `compose.local.yml`
  sets `REEF_ENV=local` and `LOCAL_DEV_BOT_CONFIG_STORE=memory` for
  `platform-api`, and the runtime only honors that fallback when
  `REEF_ENV`/profile is local/dev/test/ci and
  `BAO_ADDR` is absent. This keeps owner config editing testable in the local
  admin UI without shipping an OpenBao bypass to hosted environments. If
  `BAO_ADDR` is configured, the runtime uses the dedicated OpenBao AppRole path
  instead.
- Guard production arena-admin builds against local fixture leakage:

  ```text
  bun run --cwd apps/arena-admin build:guarded
  ```

  The guard scans the static build output for local fixture marker strings and
  the public local-dev flag names. The fixture code is wrapped in
  `import.meta.env.DEV`, so production bundles should tree-shake it out.
- ~~Add Admin API authorization middleware that binds actor identity from the
  authenticated principal, not caller-controlled headers.~~ Done for the
  browser/session and service-token admin routes; keep object-level regression
  coverage as the surface expands.
- Move CI-to-Admin API auth from scoped bearer token to GitHub Actions OIDC.
- ~~Add pre-merge OpenBao-slice verification check.~~ Done:
  `scripts/dev/bot-submission-provision-openbao.mjs` calls
  `/admin/v1/arena/bots/openbao-provision` in real CI mode and keeps explicit
  dry-run mode for local workflow checks.
- ~~Add participant config editor backed by Admin API and OpenBao.~~ Done in the
  owner-scoped `/bot-admin` surface and included in completed onboarding.
- ~~Complete initial external-account admission/onboarding.~~ Done through
  Noodle smoke #307 and fixes #308/#310/#311/#313/#315/#316; see the
  [completion record](../BOT_ARENA_RELEASE_READINESS.md#admission-and-onboarding-completion).
  Remaining hosted run-eligibility/game evidence stays in the preview sprint.
