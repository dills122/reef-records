# Reef Architecture Infrastructure Diagrams

Last aligned: 2026-07-19.

This document shows the current venue-core infrastructure shape and the target direction for the next persistence, projection, and evidence slices.

## Current Branch State

The current branch has moved the hot matching path away from runtime workers calling the engine and toward:

- durable command-log acceptance before `202`
- matching-engine direct command consumption
- in-memory hot book mutation
- durable `VenueEventBatch` publication
- asynchronous compact Postgres materialization

Current completion boundary:

```text
API 202:
  after durable command-log ack

engine processed:
  after command consumed, hot book mutated, and VenueEventBatch durably published

command offset committed:
  after durable VenueEventBatch publication

Postgres canonical materialized:
  after async materializer reads event batches and commits compact canonical rows

materializer event offset committed:
  after compact canonical Postgres commit

projection visible:
  after downstream projections catch up from canonical rows/events
```

Current important implementation pieces:

- `platform-api` owns public command intake and returns `202` only after the configured durable ingress mechanism acknowledges.
- Redpanda/Kafka-compatible command topics are the active hot-ingress promotion path; JetStream remains a comparison/fallback provider.
- Matching-engine direct consumers own ordered command partitions and mutate in-memory books.
- The matching engine publishes durable `VenueEventBatch` facts before committing command offsets.
- `platform-materializer` consumes event batches and writes compact canonical Postgres rows.
- `runtime.canonical_venue_event_batches` preserves replay-safe batch facts and checksums.
- `runtime.canonical_command_outcomes` gives command-to-batch linkage and compact engine outcome lookup.
- `/api/v1/commands/{commandId}` prefers canonical command outcomes when present and falls back to ingress/status surfaces while materialization catches up.
- Compact command-outcome projection can materialize submit results and lifecycle runtime events from event-batch outcomes without returning Postgres to the matching-engine hot path.
- Normalized orders, executions, trades, runtime events, UI views, metrics, and leaderboards remain downstream projections. Projection has a separate recorded `2.5k/5m` sustained baseline. Historical `5k/60s` count/freshness passes do not close the August 21 downstream drain failure or promote sustained `5k`; projection write cost is separate from the `10k` venue-core claim.
- Full order-table projection from this path uses compact submit command metadata carried in the event-batch outcome, with the durable command-payload join retained only as a fallback for older payloads.
- `TradeSettlementObligationMaterializer` reads settled trades from the runtime projection and materializes allocation, confirmation, affirmation, clearing, novation, obligation, instruction, attempt, leg, and ledger facts; clearing rejects and settlement breaks feed an exception-queue projection. `SettlementLedgerProjection` derives cash/security balances and per-settlement proof. These mechanisms are unit/integration and scenario tested; a sustained-simulator-load soak of the full post-trade path is not yet captured as evidence.

## Target Direction

The direction remains to keep lifecycle projection downstream and rebuildable.
Compact visibility and idempotent replay are implemented; the active projection
work is reducing WAL, tuple, and temporary-file amplification before longer
`5k` soaks or higher projection gates.

Target operating principles:

- The hot path should stay narrow: API durable command ack, engine in-memory mutation, durable event-batch publication.
- Postgres should stay out of the matching-engine hot path.
- Canonical Postgres writes should be compact, batch-oriented, idempotent, and replayable.
- Public command status should prefer canonical command outcomes when materialized and fall back to ingress/status surfaces while materialization catches up.
- Normalized read tables should be rebuildable projections, not canonical hot-path dependencies.
- Throughput claims require accounting across accepted, engine-published, materialized, projected, and replay-clean counts.

## End-To-End Target System

This diagram expands the target shape beyond venue-core persistence. It shows the intended separation between order entry, matching, canonical venue facts, operational projections, market data, settlement, account ledgers, and analytics.

End-to-end ownership rules:

- Order entry is the only public write path for trading intent. Bots and users do not write directly to runtime, market-data, settlement, account, or analytics tables.
- The matching engine owns the hot book, but the hot book is not a user-facing query store.
- Canonical venue facts are the bridge from matching to every downstream system.
- Operational order reads come from projections, with canonical command outcomes preferred for command status.
- Market data starts as projection-backed snapshots, depth, recent trades, and bars so bot reads do not load the matching engine.
- Account/risk does a bounded pre-check before durable command acceptance; settlement does final enforcement after matching facts exist.
- Settlement creates post-trade obligations, breaks, repairs, and enforcement facts without mutating matching history.
- Analytics consumes mirrored facts from canonical venue, operational, market-data, settlement, and account stores; it can lag and must be rebuildable.

## Near-Term Slice Map

1. Venue lifecycle projection.
   - Project compact submit outcomes from canonical command outcomes into `submit_results` and `runtime_events`.
   - Add full `orders` projection after event batches carry submit command metadata or the projector joins durable command payloads.
   - Expand cancel/modify/fill/reject outcomes from canonical rows into normalized read tables. Cancel/modify commands are already processed and acked end-to-end on the direct-stream path (dispatch, outcome, ack) with dedicated tests (`TestProcessorProcessesModifyAndCancelCommands`); this step is about projecting those outcomes into the normalized `orders` read model, not about command processing itself.
   - Keep projections downstream and rebuildable.
   - Add deterministic tests that event batch, canonical rows, projection rows, and query APIs agree.

2. Evidence promotion.
   - Run `make dev-smoke-venue-event-materializer` against Docker as the local materializer gate.
   - Extend the live gate to assert projected `submit_results` and `runtime_events` once the projector is enabled with `STREAM_ACK_PROJECTION_SOURCE=venue-event-batch`.
   - Promote the Redpanda/Kafka-compatible path to longer remote evidence only after replay/checksum and materialization smoke are clean.
   - Measure accepted, engine-published, materialized, projected, drain lag, and replay/checksum results together.
