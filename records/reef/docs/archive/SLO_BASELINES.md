# Reef Baseline SLO Targets (Sprint Baseline)

## Purpose

Provide explicit baseline service-level objectives for early-stage architecture discipline and regression detection.

## Targets

1. Order ingestion and engine round-trip
- Success rate: >= 99.0% for valid submit requests in steady-state load tests.
- Latency: p95 <= 25ms, p99 <= 75ms.

2. External boundary (`/api/v1`) validation path
- Success rate: >= 99.9% for syntactically valid authenticated/idempotent requests.
- Latency overhead vs non-boundary path: p95 delta <= 10ms.

3. Compare/Affirmation stage (post-match baseline)
- Stage transition success: >= 99.0% for happy-path scenarios.
- Time to transition (simulated clock adjusted): p95 <= 2s equivalent.

4. Clearing decisioning stage (post-match baseline)
- Stage transition success: >= 99.0% for valid affirmed inputs.
- Decision latency: p95 <= 3s equivalent.

5. Netting batch processing (post-match baseline)
- Batch completion success: >= 99.0%.
- Batch processing latency: p95 <= 5s equivalent for baseline scenario size.

6. Settlement intake enqueue
- Enqueue success: >= 99.9%.
- Enqueue latency: p95 <= 500ms, p99 <= 1s.

## Measurement Notes

- Baselines are validated by deterministic load/simulation scenarios and CI test coverage where practical.
- Targets are intentionally conservative for current architecture maturity and should be tightened after dev-env sprint stabilization.

## Single-Instance Capacity Goal

Purpose:
- establish an explicit scaling target for one runtime + one engine instance before horizontal scaling.

Historical note: the tiered near/mid/stretch ladder below predates the durable-ingress and no-DB throughput work in [`PERFORMANCE_LEARNINGS.md`](../PERFORMANCE_LEARNINGS.md). Measured evidence there already sustains ~10,000 req/s materialized (durable canonical persistence, e.g. the July 4 venue-event batch materializer checkpoint and the July 6 stream-ack no-DB retention checkpoint) and ~15,000 req/s on the no-DB front-door/engine path (Netty hot-path accepted-async checkpoint), both well past the old "stretch" tier. The ladder is kept as historical scaling context, not a current target; use the planning anchor below for the live target.

Targets (historical, superseded — see note above):

1. Near-term target (after dev-env + post-match foundation hardening):
- sustained throughput: 500 to 1,000 req/s
- latency: p95 < 20ms, p99 < 75ms on core order APIs

2. Mid-term target (after persistence and rate-limit backend hardening):
- sustained throughput: 1,500 to 3,000 req/s
- latency: p95 < 30ms, p99 < 120ms

3. Stretch target (well-tuned single-node profile):
- sustained throughput: 3,000 to 5,000 req/s
- maintain stable error rates and acceptable latency envelopes

Planning anchor (current, live target):
- active bot-arena scaling objective is 7,500 completed commands/sec per runtime + engine instance, with 10,000 preferred.
- accepted req/s remains a diagnostic number; release gates use completed throughput, terminal accounting, bounded backlog, and clean drain.
- horizontal scale-out should multiply this per-instance unit after durability, p99 latency, success rate, and no-loss accounting are stable.
