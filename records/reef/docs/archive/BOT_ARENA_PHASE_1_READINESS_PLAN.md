# Bot Arena Phase 1 Readiness Plan

## Purpose

Define the first implementation slice needed to make Bot Arena locally real:
controlled market-maker bots, NPC trader bots, local custom test bots, basic
arena scoring, and a repeatable smoke gate that proves the whole loop uses the
normal Reef venue command path.

This is not the public-submission or hosted-tournament milestone. Phase 1 is the
operator-controlled/local proof that the arena model works before exposing it to
external bot authors.

Status note (updated 2026-07-18): this file is historical Phase 1 planning. The
local gates described here landed, and later work added the hosted admin app,
public leaderboard read, identity/ownership stores, same-repository submission
pipeline, OpenBao provisioning, and registry sync. Current execution lives in
[`WORK_PLAN.md`](../WORK_PLAN.md#active-execution-ladder); external submission
status lives in
[`BOT_ARENA_RELEASE_READINESS.md`](../BOT_ARENA_RELEASE_READINESS.md). Do not
use the non-goals or recommended work order below as current implementation
claims.

## Current Foundations

Reef already has the main pieces Phase 1 should compose:

- Bot SDK authoring, fixture, hosted-runner, hosted-worker, live-read, and venue
  adapter scripts under `packages/bot-sdk/` and `scripts/dev/`.
- Example bots including simple/lifecycle-safe/refreshing market makers,
  multi-symbol strategy, and technical-indicator strategy bots.
- Go simulator persona/session config with actor attribution, strategy IDs,
  multi-instrument routing, deterministic seeds, and JSON reports.
- Platform arena registry, bot-version lifecycle states, run records, run result
  storage, leaderboard reads, and bot-version risk checks.
- Public `/api/v1` order command paths, command status, market-data reads,
  own-order reads, and data availability reporting.
- Local smoke targets for bot SDK live runs, hosted SES/container execution,
  arena bot-version risk, and arena run-result ingestion.
- Local positive and negative persisted arena gates:
  `make dev-smoke-bot-arena-local-persist` and
  `make dev-smoke-bot-arena-local-negative`.
- Static report rendering and report-index comparison:
  `make dev-render-bot-arena-report` and
  `make dev-render-bot-arena-report-index`.

## Phase 1 Goal

Ship one local arena run path that can:

1. Seed a deterministic market session.
2. Register or select a small built-in bot set.
3. Run controlled market makers and NPC/background traders.
4. Run two or three local custom test bots through the hosted Bot SDK path.
5. Submit all accepted actions through `/api/v1`, never direct table mutation.
6. Wait for command completion, materialization, projection, and read visibility
   according to existing local gates.
7. Score the run with a minimal versioned scoring policy.
8. Persist run results and expose a deterministic leaderboard.
9. Produce a JSON report that can be used as the first arena regression artifact.

Current status: the local arena run path, persisted positive/negative gates, enforcement-event persistence, leaderboard readback, and static report rendering exist. Remaining local hardening is paced shared-time `3-5m` proof with stronger fill/cancel/open-order pressure, then the hosted/backbone gate.

## Historical Build Plan

### 1. Local Arena Orchestrator

Implemented as the local arena runner path; keep details below as design context for future hosted/scheduled reuse.

Candidate home:

- `services/simulator/internal/arena/config`
- `services/simulator/internal/arena/catalog`
- `services/simulator/internal/arena/orchestrator`
- `services/simulator/internal/arena/enforcement`
- `services/simulator/internal/arena/scoring`
- `services/simulator/internal/arena/report`
- `services/simulator/cmd/arena-local-run`
- `scripts/dev/arena-local-run.mjs` as the repository ergonomics wrapper

Responsibilities:

- read an arena mode/session config from `packages/scenario-definitions/`
- seed reference/auth data through existing guarded setup paths
- start controlled background flow through the simulator/load-tester or a small
  SDK-hosted bot loop
- build and run local custom bots through hosted worker execution
- map approved bot actions to venue command requests with the SDK venue adapter
- submit commands to `/api/v1`
- collect command status, order reads, trades, market data, and data availability
- write one arena run report
- optionally post the score payload to the existing arena run-result ingestion
  route

Phase 1 should not become a throwaway script. Keep the first runnable surface
small, but put the behavior in simulator-owned packages so the next slices can
reuse it for hosted runs, scheduled runs, and smoke gates.

### 2. Built-In Bot Catalog

Create a small versioned catalog of operator-controlled bots.

Initial catalog:

- `builtin-mm-simple`: posts a bid and offer around the visible midpoint
- `builtin-mm-lifecycle-safe`: checks own open orders before quoting
- `builtin-mm-refreshing`: cancels/requotes stale quotes
- `builtin-npc-passive-limit`: passive participant that rests away from mid
- `builtin-npc-momentum`: simple taker/follower using public bars or snapshots
- `builtin-npc-noise`: low-size randomized background flow with fixed seed

The catalog should capture:

- bot ID
- version
- source/artifact path
- role: market-maker, npc, benchmark, competitor, or monitor
- default config
- expected fixture
- action/risk limits
- visible-data policy version
- score eligibility
- public leaderboard eligibility

House bots are infrastructure actors, not public competitors. Their trading and
P&L should be retained for diagnostics and operator tuning, but they should not
appear on public leaderboards by default.

### 3. Local Custom Test Bots

Add local-only custom bot fixtures before opening the PR submission path.

Initial set:

- conservative valid bot
- aggressive but rule-abiding bot
- intentionally failing or abusive bot used to prove rejection/quarantine paths

These bots should use the same manifest shape intended for future submissions:

```text
bots/<bot-name>/bot.json
bots/<bot-name>/index.ts
```

Phase 1 does not need public branch protection or real OpenBao provisioning for
these bots. It does need the same SDK validation and hosted execution gates.

### 4. First Arena Mode Config

Add one deterministic mode under `packages/scenario-definitions/`.

Candidate:

```text
packages/scenario-definitions/arena/equity-sprint.v1.yaml
```

Minimum fields:

- mode ID and version
- scenario/run IDs and seed
- instrument universe
- session duration or tick count
- starting cash/equity assumptions
- controlled market-maker bot refs
- NPC/background bot refs
- competitor bot refs
- visible-data policy version
- action policy version
- risk policy version
- scoring policy version
- replay/drift expectations

Keep the first mode narrow: one or two equities, fixed seed, short run, final
equity headline score.

## Enforcement Model

### Run Freeze

Run freeze is the first automatic containment layer.

Behavior:

- scoped to one arena run
- stops the bot from receiving further ticks or submitting further actions
- records `frozen=true`, `disqualified=true`, `reasonCode`, policy version, run
  ID, bot ID, version ID, artifact hash, and timestamp
- does not automatically change the persistent bot-version lifecycle state

Initial freeze triggers:

- malformed hosted output
- repeated invalid actions
- repeated command rejects attributable to bot behavior
- timeout loop
- crash loop
- action count above policy
- open-order count above policy
- cancel/replace behavior above policy
- order price outside collar
- attempted instrument or order type outside mode policy

### Persistent Ban Or Quarantine

Persistent ban/quarantine is stored with arena-owned bot metadata, at the same
storage boundary as bot identity, bot versions, qualification reports, operator
decisions, and run records.

Behavior:

- applies to the exact `botId + versionId` by default
- blocks that version before venue command acceptance
- requires an admin/operator override or a newly submitted bot version
- records operator actor, reason, correlation ID, timestamp, and policy version
- must not be silently cleared by a later run

Phase 1 should prefer version-level ban/quarantine. Principal-level bans are
deferred until there is a clearer public-submission abuse model.

Persistent ban/quarantine triggers should be stricter than run freeze:

- sandbox/source policy bypass attempt
- denied API/global usage in hosted mode
- repeated severe run freezes across runs
- operator-confirmed malicious behavior
- artifact or manifest integrity mismatch

## Initial Circuit Breakers

The first breaker set should be deterministic and tick-aware. Most breakers
should reject or freeze in Phase 1; persistent ban should remain an explicit
operator or severe-policy action.

Initial defaults to tune:

- `maxActionsPerTick`: competitors `3-5`, house market makers `6-10`
- `maxOrdersPerRun`: hard cap per bot/run
- `maxOpenOrdersPerBotInstrument`: competitors `5-10`, house market makers
  `20-50`
- `maxInvalidActionsPerRun`: freeze at `3`
- `maxConsecutiveInvalidTicks`: freeze at `2`
- `maxTickTimeoutsPerRun`: freeze at `2`
- `maxConsecutiveCrashes`: freeze at `1-2`
- `maxRejectRateWindow`: freeze when more than half of the last `10` attempted
  actions are bot-caused rejects
- `maxCancelReplaceRatio`: warn first; freeze only on extreme behavior, with an
  initial candidate threshold around `10` cancels per fill for competitors
- `priceCollarBps`: reject orders too far from the mode reference price or
  visible midpoint
- `allowedInstruments`: strict mode-level allowlist
- `allowedOrderTypes`: start with `LIMIT` only

Every breaker decision should produce an arena enforcement event with:

- `runId`
- `botId`
- `versionId`
- `policyVersion`
- `decision`: allow, reject, freeze, quarantine, ban
- `reasonCode`
- observed counters/window values
- accepted command IDs if any action reached venue intake
- timestamp

## House Bot Risk Mode

House bots may need privileged liquidity behavior so the market can function
before enough competitor flow exists. Treat that as explicit mode config, not an
implicit bypass.

Example shape:

```yaml
riskProfile:
  type: house_liquidity
  assetLedgerMode: bypass
  scoreEligible: false
  publicLeaderboard: false
  maxActionsPerTick: 10
  maxOpenOrdersPerInstrument: 50
```

House bots may bypass cash/equity checks when configured with
`assetLedgerMode: bypass`.

House bots must still obey:

- hosted sandbox restrictions
- action schema validation
- allowed instrument and order-type policy
- price collars
- max open-order limits
- max actions per tick
- kill switch and run freeze
- market-wide safety breakers

This lets a house market maker lose money without weakening venue integrity.

## Healthy Market Target

The first arena health goal:

```text
A competitor bot can reliably find visible liquidity, trade against it, and
receive stable public market feedback without the book collapsing, crossing, or
becoming stale.
```

Initial measurable targets:

- top of book exists for primary instruments for at least `80-90%` of ticks
  after warmup
- median spread remains under the mode threshold, initially likely `10-25 bps`
  for an equity sprint
- at least a configured minimum number of trades completes during the run
- visible depth exists on both sides for most ticks
- crossed-book observations are zero
- empty-book duration stays below a configured threshold
- market-data and own-order projections drain by end of run
- accepted/completed/materialized command accounting gap is zero
- house market makers remain active and are not frozen by normal behavior

The first bot mix should include:

- at least one two-sided market maker
- one refreshing/requote market maker
- one passive background trader
- one aggressive/taker flow bot
- one value/noise flow bot
- one market health monitor actor
- deterministic reference price or regime model

The market health monitor is not a trading competitor. It records health signals
and can fail the smoke when the arena produced an unusable market.

### 5. Scoring V0

Implement a minimal scoring policy that can run from arena report facts.

Headline metric:

- final equity

Retained secondary metrics:

- realized/unrealized PnL where available
- trade count
- fill count
- order count
- reject count
- invalid action count
- timeout/crash count
- order-to-trade ratio
- disqualified flag and reason

The score format must include `modeId` and `scoringPolicyVersion` so old results
stay explainable after scoring changes.

Next scoring slices after the 15 minute reporting/infra gate:

1. **Portfolio/P&L accounting**: reconstruct per-bot executions, maintain cash
   and inventory by instrument, mark inventory to deterministic mid/last/reference
   prices, and report realized P&L, unrealized P&L, final equity, and drawdown.
2. **Market-quality contribution**: attribute quote uptime, two-sided presence,
   spread tightness, depth, replenishment after fills, fill quality, and
   order-to-trade/cancel behavior to the bot that supplied the liquidity.
3. **Price movement and impact**: compare pre/post mid, last trade, and spread
   around each bot's actions; reward useful price discovery and liquidity
   improvement while penalizing destabilizing impact, crossed/empty books,
   excessive volatility, and toxic quote behavior.
4. **Risk-adjusted score**: combine P&L with inventory concentration, max
   drawdown, rejected/failed/timed-out command penalties, freeze/disqualification
   penalties, and mode-specific instrument risk categories.
5. **House-bot separation**: keep house liquidity providers out of public
   competitor scoring while still reporting their P&L, inventory, quote quality,
   and market-health contribution for tuning and diagnostics.

Until those slices land, `score-v0` should be treated as a participation and
policy-compliance score, not a competitive trading-performance score.

Current scoring/reporting assumptions:

- The current score/report follow-up plan is tracked in
  [`BOT_ARENA_SCORING_AND_REPORTING_NEXT_STEPS.md`](../BOT_ARENA_SCORING_AND_REPORTING_NEXT_STEPS.md).
- Public competitive scoring ranks only score-eligible competitor bots. House
  and NPC bots remain diagnostics-only unless a future mode explicitly changes
  that behavior.
- House liquidity providers are market-health infrastructure actors. They should
  not be considered bad actors for losing money, accumulating inventory, or
  trading aggressively when they stay inside configured house risk controls.
- Bot display names are presentation metadata only. Reports and persisted facts
  must continue carrying stable `botId` and `versionId` for audit, replay, and
  joins.
- The current operator report may include command-mix trading metrics such as
  submitted/canceled/modified commands, side and instrument counts, and gross
  submitted notional. These are diagnostic inputs, not the final economic score.
- Participant-scoped fill attribution and zero-fee cash/inventory diagnostics
  are now present in local arena reports. They are diagnostic inputs only:
  public `score-v0` still ranks participation and policy compliance, not
  trading performance. Realized lot-matched P&L, fee-adjusted final equity,
  quote-quality contribution, and price-impact attribution are not scored until
  the next scoring-policy version is accepted.
- Fee handling starts as a zero-fee placeholder. The next scoring version should
  make maker/taker fees configurable by mode before using P&L competitively.
- Inventory penalties should start mild and configurable so they discourage
  one-way risk hoarding without punishing normal liquidity-provision inventory.
- Price movement should be descriptive first. Rewards or penalties for impact
  should wait until the report can separate useful price discovery from
  destabilizing behavior.

### 6. Real Run-Result Ingestion

Extend the current result ingestion smoke so it can ingest the actual hosted bot
summary/report emitted by the local arena orchestrator.

The gate should prove:

- run record exists before results are posted
- bot versions referenced by the run are approved or active for the local policy
- per-bot result rows are persisted
- leaderboard ranks deterministically by scoring policy
- rejected/disqualified bots are represented explicitly

### 7. Local Arena Smoke Gate

Status: landed. Keep the command names below as the local regression surface.

Add:

```bash
make dev-smoke-bot-arena-local
```

Persisted local gate:

```bash
make dev-smoke-bot-arena-local-persist
```

The persisted local gate first runs the same live arena path through `/api/v1`,
then posts the resulting report through gateway-backed `/admin/v1/arena/*`
routes. This keeps raw internal routes out of the workflow while still proving arena run-result persistence,
enforcement-event persistence, and leaderboard readback.

Expected proof:

- stack is reachable
- arena registry/risk controls are enabled for the local profile
- built-in market makers submit through `/api/v1`
- NPC/background flow submits through `/api/v1`
- custom bots pass or fail SDK gates as expected
- command status reaches terminal states
- data availability report is captured
- final scoring report is written
- operator HTML report renders leaderboard, bot results, enforcement events,
  command accounting, persistence readback, and projection-drain evidence
- run results are persisted
- leaderboard returns deterministic ranking for the fixed seed

After the short smoke is stable, use the local hardening gate for meaningful
pre-soak evidence:

```bash
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=reef \
ORDER_LIFECYCLE_PROJECTOR_ENABLED=true \
MARKET_DATA_PROJECTOR_ENABLED=true \
ORDER_LIFECYCLE_PROJECTOR_POLL_MS=100 \
MARKET_DATA_PROJECTOR_POLL_MS=100 \
make dev-reset

ORDER_LIFECYCLE_PROJECTOR_ENABLED=true \
MARKET_DATA_PROJECTOR_ENABLED=true \
ORDER_LIFECYCLE_PROJECTOR_POLL_MS=100 \
MARKET_DATA_PROJECTOR_POLL_MS=100 \
make dev-hardening-bot-arena-local
```

This defaults to the multi-instrument local arena mode for `180` seconds, uses
terminal command accounting, requires projection drain, writes a compact arena
report, and writes a compact hardening summary. The hardening wrapper requests
`--report-shape=compact` from the arena runner by default so multi-minute runs
do not create massive per-tick JSON artifacts that exceed Node's maximum string
size during summary/report rendering. Use `ARGS="--report-shape=full"` only for
short debugging runs where the full per-tick `sessionReports` payload is needed.
Existing compact reports can be summarized again with:

```bash
ORDER_LIFECYCLE_PROJECTOR_ENABLED=true \
MARKET_DATA_PROJECTOR_ENABLED=true \
bun scripts/dev/arena-local-hardening-run.mjs \
  --input-report=/tmp/reef-arena-local-hardening.json \
  --summary-out=/tmp/reef-arena-local-hardening.summary.json
```

It must run against a local stack started with both
`ORDER_LIFECYCLE_PROJECTOR_ENABLED=true` and
`MARKET_DATA_PROJECTOR_ENABLED=true`; otherwise top-of-book/depth health samples
do not reflect the live projected book. The arena runner preflights both
projector status endpoints whenever live mode requires projection drain, and
fails closed before traffic starts if it cannot verify that both projectors are
enabled. Setting those variables only on the runner command is insufficient; the
Compose stack itself must be reset or recreated with them. The summary includes
per-ticker market-quality evidence:
sampled top-of-book/depth, spread distribution,
submitted/completed/rejected/timed-out commands, filled commands, trade count,
side-level fill coverage, traded quantity, notional, fill rate, and actor-class
contribution. It also records tick runtime and command intake/status/total
latency distributions overall, by scheduling class, and by bot role so tuning
can distinguish house-responsive pressure from NPC and contestant tick traffic.
The mode-level health targets can also require per-minute command pressure, such
as cancel-route activity and house liquidity-provider command activity, so short
smokes and 180 second hardening runs prove lifecycle plumbing is exercised at
their own scale. The local profile records per-side fill coverage but does not
require every submitted side to fill on every instrument; that stricter assertion
belongs on longer market-quality gates where the traffic mix is tuned for side
coverage instead of local infrastructure pressure. It must fail closed when
commands time out, command finality is incomplete, market health fails,
per-ticker market quality fails, required command pressure is missing, projection
drain fails, freeze events appear, or house liquidity providers have empty
own-order readback. This is the working gate before promoting a profile to the
longer `15` minute
quickest-real-game simulation check.

First operator-facing UI artifact:

```bash
make dev-render-bot-arena-report \
  REPORT=/tmp/reef-arena-local-tick-run-persist.json \
  OUT=/tmp/reef-arena-local-tick-run-persist.html
```

Multiple run artifacts can be compared with:

```bash
make dev-render-bot-arena-report-index \
  REPORTS=/tmp/reef-arena-local-tick-run-persist.json,/tmp/reef-arena-local-tick-run-negative.json \
  OUT=/tmp/reef-arena-local-tick-run-index.html
```

This is the Phase 1 UI foothold: a static run report generated from the arena
JSON artifact plus a static report index for comparing positive, negative, and
future hosted artifacts. It is intentionally separate from a live control room
so Phase 1 can prove run evidence before adding a browser-operated workflow.

## Explicit Non-Goals For Phase 1

- public bot submissions
- real GitHub branch-protection enforcement
- real GitHub OIDC to OpenBao provisioning
- full analytics microservice
- production scheduler
- live control-room UI
- multi-cloud run-plane deployment polish
- full account ledger, buying power, or settlement expansion
- broad tournament/season mechanics

## Runner Isolation Direction

Phase 1 should avoid one long-lived Docker container per bot. Twenty extra local
containers would add operational noise before the arena protocol is stable, and
the per-bot memory overhead is not needed for the first local proof.

The preferred near-term direction is a small pool of TypeScript-capable runners:

1. The arena orchestrator talks to runners through a stable bot-runtime protocol.
2. Each runner hosts multiple bots using Deno workers and SES compartments where
   practical.
3. The runner receives only arena snapshots, bot config, and deterministic seed
   material.
4. The runner returns proposed actions, bot logs, resource counters, and
   heartbeat/status reports.
5. The orchestrator owns venue transport, risk/enforcement, scoring, command
   status waiting, persistence, and lifecycle decisions.
6. Hosted/public phases can put the same runner protocol behind one stronger
   outer container, gVisor sandbox, or microVM boundary per runner group without
   rewriting arena orchestration.

The worker should not receive direct network, filesystem, environment,
subprocess, credential, or venue API capability. Deno's permission model is the
preferred local runtime guardrail for TypeScript, while SES compartments harden
the JavaScript object-capability surface inside the runner. These are useful
defense layers, but not a full replacement for an outer sandbox when bots become
public or hostile.

Initial grouping target:

- local dev: 1 runner process with 2-4 Deno workers
- local smoke: 2 runner processes with 2-4 workers each
- hosted internal: fixed runner container pool, each container hosting multiple
  workers and no direct network except the parent-owned control channel
- public/custom future: same protocol behind gVisor or equivalent outer sandbox

Each worker can host more than one low-rate bot, but the scheduler should treat
work as per-bot tick jobs rather than one endless loop per bot. This lets the
runner enforce per-bot time budgets, reject late tick results, recycle workers
after a fixed number of ticks/runs, and isolate overloaded bots from the rest of
the pool.

### Runner Throughput Guardrails

The arena should assume that bot runtime capacity is finite and explicitly
metered. A target like 500 proposed actions per second is feasible only if the
bot contract stays narrow and the runner does not perform venue I/O itself.

Initial guardrails:

- `maxTickWallTimeMs`: default 25-50 ms for competitor bots
- `maxTickCpuTimeMs`: tracked when the runtime exposes it
- `maxActionsPerTick`: still enforced by arena policy even if the runner is fast
- `maxQueuedTicksPerBot`: 1, with stale ticks dropped or marked late
- `maxRunnerQueueDepth`: freeze or shed lowest-priority custom bots before house
  market makers
- `maxResultBytesPerTick`: cap action/log output to prevent memory pressure
- `workerRecycleTicks`: recycle workers after N ticks or after any policy breach
- `runnerHeartbeatMs`: missing heartbeat freezes assigned bots for that run

The scheduler should reserve capacity for house market makers and health-monitor
bots. Custom bots should consume the remaining budget. If a runner saturates, the
correct first response is not to let latency compound; the arena should mark
late ticks, drop stale work, and freeze bots that repeatedly exceed their budget.

The first implementation slice for validating these assumptions is the isolated
runner benchmark in `docs/BOT_ARENA_RUNNER_BENCH.md`. That bench intentionally
measures Deno runner processes, Deno workers, synthetic bot ticks, RSS, tick
latency, and proposed-action throughput without involving the Reef venue API.
The same doc also tracks the follow-on hosted-bot bench that uses real Bot SDK
examples and hosted artifacts while still keeping venue transport out of scope.
The first pooled runner smoke now adds a JSON-line worker protocol with
`loadBot`, `runScenario`, `startSession`, `runTick`, `stopSession`, `freezeBot`,
`heartbeat`, and `shutdown`; that protocol is the preferred handoff boundary for
the arena orchestrator.
`scripts/dev/arena-local-run.mjs` is the first pre-venue arena wrapper around
that pool: it runs hosted fixture jobs, scores bot results, emits freeze events,
and writes a deterministic local leaderboard.
`scripts/dev/arena-runner-tick-smoke.mjs` proves the same worker can accept
orchestrator-owned ticks and return per-tick actions plus venue command drafts.

For a rough first sizing model, a bot at 500 actions per second with 5 actions
per tick requires 100 ticks per second. Ten bots at that rate means 1,000
bot-ticks per second before validation and command submission. That is plausible
only for simple strategies, batched snapshots, bounded output, and a runner pool
with backpressure. It should not be the Phase 1 default.

Phase 1 target should be much smaller and deterministic:

- 10-20 bots total
- 1-10 ticks per second per bot
- 3-10 actions per tick depending on bot class
- runner utilization and late-tick counts recorded in every arena report

### Parked Rust/WASM SDK Direction

The preferred long-term competitive bot lane is still Rust compiled to WASM,
with TinyGo as a likely second SDK once the ABI is stable. This is parked for
Phase 1 implementation but should shape the runner protocol now.

The important contract is language-neutral:

```text
init(config) -> bot_state
on_tick(snapshot, bot_state) -> tick_result
```

Rust/WASM remains attractive because it gives the arena cheap isolated artifacts,
bounded memory, deterministic host calls, no direct network or filesystem by
default, stable artifact hashing, and a clean ban/replay/audit model. The
TypeScript runner should therefore behave like one implementation of the same
bot ABI, not like the permanent platform contract.

## Readiness Criteria

Phase 1 is ready when a clean local stack can run:

```bash
make dev-smoke-bot-arena-local
```

and produce all of:

- arena run JSON report
- command status evidence
- read-surface/data-availability evidence
- per-bot score output
- persisted run-bot results
- leaderboard response
- deterministic repeat result for the same seed

## Recommended Work Order

1. Promote the pooled runner protocol into the arena package boundary.
2. Wire `startSession`/`runTick`/`stopSession` into `arena-local-run`.
3. Add arena package skeleton — no `services/simulator/internal/arena` Go package exists; the actual arena runner/orchestrator logic lives in `scripts/dev/arena-*.mjs` (e.g. `arena-local-run.mjs`, `arena-runner-pool-smoke.mjs`) plus the Kotlin control-plane module `services/platform-runtime/src/main/kotlin/com/reef/platform/application/arena/`.
4. Add the arena mode config and built-in bot catalog shape.
5. Add local custom bot fixtures.
6. Route accepted venue command drafts through `/api/v1`.
7. Harden enforcement policy and run-freeze report fields.
8. Harden scoring v0 and report shape.
9. Wire real run-result ingestion from the arena report.
10. Add `make dev-smoke-bot-arena-local`.
11. Add drift/replay checks once the first smoke report is stable.

## Follow-Up After Phase 1

After the local smoke is reliable, plan the next slices:

- stronger bot safety/risk policy
- fairness policy and disqualification rules
- OpenBao-backed config preflight
- hosted runner service shape
- analytics API/service boundary
- replay/debug artifact storage
- public bot submission hardening
