# Documentation Cleanup Plan

## Purpose

Keep current planning easy to scan while preserving historical evidence. Reef
has valuable benchmark reports, sprint plans, audits, and design notes, but
active work should not require reading every historical document.

## Document Classes

### Active Operating Docs

These shape current work:

- `CURRENT_STATUS.md`
- `WORK_PLAN.md`
- `BOT_ARENA_RELEASE_READINESS.md` while external bot intake is an active release goal
- `BOT_ARENA_INVITE_PREVIEW_SPRINT.md` while the invite-only fork preview is active
- `REEF_BOT_ARENA_SEPARATION_PROMOTION.md` as the current separation evidence;
  `REEF_BOT_ARENA_SEPARATION_SPRINT.md` is an implemented design record
- `DECISIONS.md`
- steering docs under `docs/steering/`
- current contract and boundary docs
- current sprint/tasking docs linked from `WORK_PLAN.md`

Rule: if a doc is active, `CURRENT_STATUS.md` or `WORK_PLAN.md` should say why.

### Evidence Docs

These prove or explain a claim:

- benchmark reports
- crash-gate reports
- scenario assertion reports
- dated hardening/audit results
- migration inventories

Rule: keep them near the active topic while they are frequently cited. Move
them under `docs/archive/` once they are superseded and only needed as history.

### Historical Planning Docs

These describe past plans or superseded approaches:

- old sprint plans
- pre-D-041 throughput plans
- obsolete baseline reports
- design investigations that no longer drive current work

Rule: move to `docs/archive/` and leave a short note in the archive index.

## Cleanup Rules

- Do not delete decision records, benchmark evidence, or security reports.
- Prefer moving stale planning docs to `docs/archive/` over rewriting history.
- Update links when a moved doc is still referenced by active docs.
- Keep one active execution ladder in `WORK_PLAN.md`.
- Keep `CURRENT_STATUS.md` short enough to orient work, not repeat every report.
- Mark historical scope directly in old docs when moving them would break too
  many links in one change.

## Near-Term Cleanup Queue

1. Moved in the 2026-07 cleanup pass:
   - `ARCHITECTURE_THROUGHPUT_PLAN.md`
   - `ARCHITECTURE_THROUGHPUT_TRACKER.md`
   - `STREAM_ACK_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md`
   - `THROUGHPUT_SCALING_WORK_PLAN.md`
   - `SPRINT_CRITICAL_QUALITY_HARDENING.md`
2. Move old sprint/baseline docs after any still-active tasking is extracted:
   - dated Bot Arena and benchmark baselines that are no longer active gates
3. Split Bot Arena docs into active product work versus historical evidence.
4. Lifecycle V1 has landed. Keep its sprint doc active only for remaining
   scenario evidence and bounded operator hardening; archive after that active
   tasking moves to a successor, preserving the implementation record.

September 4 alignment: `WORK_PLAN.md#work-board` is the repository status view;
the dated implementation audit supplies evidence. Public status/Arena pages,
auth/provisioning, throughput handoff, intake rollout and supplemental backlogs
must defer to those current statuses. Preserve dated reports and accepted ADR
history; use supersession notes instead of rewriting historical results.

## Acceptance For A Cleanup PR

- active docs still link cleanly
- moved docs are listed in `docs/archive/README.md`
- `WORK_PLAN.md` remains the active execution source
- no benchmark, decision, or security evidence is deleted
