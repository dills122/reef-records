# Reef Current Status

## Purpose

This is a dated implementation snapshot. Use the [documentation map](README.md)
for today's entry points and [WORK_PLAN.md](WORK_PLAN.md) for the repository
execution ladder. Verify later code, release, and throughput changes before
describing this snapshot as current.

Last aligned: 2026-09-04 against `master` at `cebbffc1`. Hosted observations
below retain their recorded dates; this alignment did not re-run release gates.

## Current Project State

Reef has moved beyond a repository skeleton. The current implementation includes:

- Kotlin platform runtime with `/api/v1` submit, cancel, and modify command paths
- boundary idempotency, auth/rate-limit hooks, abuse protection, command capture, and command status lookup
- explicit runtime, boundary, auth, admin, orchestration, analytics, and command-log schemas applied through local migrations
- runtime query surfaces for orders, trades, events, and trace timelines
- admin CLI scaffolding for reference data, roles, calendars, simulation controls, and trace inspection
- Go matching engine with hidden-book matching, partial fills, multi-match, cancel, modify, HTTP, gRPC, and direct stream-consumer paths
- protobuf contracts for order execution commands and results
- Go simulator/load tester with persona/session support, deterministic replay checks, stress reports, and intake benchmarks
- Docker-first local setup, reset, smoke, stress, replay, and DigitalOcean benchmark automation

The general Reef operator UI is still early; Arena has its own bounded admin
surface. Post-trade has a credible first fact chain and exception projection,
but remains more evidence/report oriented than operator-workflow oriented. The
current strongest verification surface is the local/remote simulator and
benchmark harness, not the UI.

Current product split:

- Reef is the institutional equity-market simulation platform. It owns venue
  intake, matching, post-trade lifecycle, settlement, replay, audit, scenarios,
  and operator workflows.
- Bot Arena is a bot trading competition/game that uses Reef as its simulation
  environment. It should keep using Reef's public command, market-data,
  settlement, and admin contracts rather than becoming a parallel platform.

Bot Arena release call:

- the platform is ready for an operator-controlled preview with built-in bots
  and same-repository test submissions; the chosen next release is an
  invite-only, fork-based preview, not open self-service intake
- the same-repository smoke bot proved validation, container isolation,
  provisioning, merge, and registry sync; the deployed public leaderboard is
  healthy but currently has no public scored runs
- fork submissions now persist as `pending_invite_review`; trusted approval
  binds maintainer GitHub identity and the exact head SHA before automatically
  dispatching base-branch provisioning, and a changed SHA resets approval
- live `master` protection now requires `registry-diff-and-provision`; ordinary
  PRs receive a successful no-op result while fork bot submissions remain
  pending until trusted approval/provisioning completes
- external-account admission/onboarding is complete: `noodle-ventures` smoke
  PR #307 and the July 22-23 approval, provisioning, secret-access, and
  ownership-sync fixes close that checkpoint. See the
  [completion record](./BOT_ARENA_RELEASE_READINESS.md#admission-and-onboarding-completion).
  Open/self-service intake remains a separate release decision.
- separation promotion is local/release-equivalent Compose evidence, not a
  hosted rehearsal. The Hetzner Compose fallback still names the Reef-core
  image; application deployment automation now explicitly selects the immutable
  `reef-arena-platform-runtime` image under D-054. Hosted route/storage and
  preview rehearsal evidence remain separate release gates.
- the corrected 2026-07-21 local three-policy matrix passes with immutable
  roster bindings, 30 run-scoped fills per policy, complete reconciliation,
  zero command-accounting gap, and preserved maker/taker attribution; hosted
  game repetition and multi-seed evidence remain release gates
- use [`BOT_ARENA_INVITE_PREVIEW_SPRINT.md`](./BOT_ARENA_INVITE_PREVIEW_SPRINT.md)
  for admission, cutoff, policy, and recorded-run tasking; the Reef/Arena
  separation prerequisite is promoted with recorded local evidence in
  [`REEF_BOT_ARENA_SEPARATION_PROMOTION.md`](./archive/REEF_BOT_ARENA_SEPARATION_PROMOTION.md);
  use
  [`BOT_ARENA_RELEASE_READINESS.md`](./BOT_ARENA_RELEASE_READINESS.md) for
  launch gates and current blockers

## Active Architecture Direction

Keep these distinctions explicit:

- `sync-result` remains the deterministic correctness and compatibility mode.
- Postgres `captured-ack` remains a local fallback and A/B baseline.
- JetStream `stream-ack` proved the durable-acceptance shape, but July 2026 evidence showed the generic worker-to-engine path and write-heavy projection path are not the final high-throughput base.
- The active high-throughput venue-core path uses a Kafka-compatible durable command log, explicit command partitions, matching-engine direct consumption, atomic venue-event publication plus command-offset commit, `read_committed` materialization, and asynchronous Postgres persistence. Matching shards now use static Kafka ownership-group membership, and startup replays retained commands to committed transaction boundaries before processing new work.
- `202 Accepted` still means the configured durable ingress/log producer has acknowledged the command. Do not weaken that contract.
- The current command intake contract is captured in [`COMMAND_INTAKE_PROCESS.md`](./COMMAND_INTAKE_PROCESS.md): submit, cancel, and modify share the hot path; lifecycle mutations require routing and ownership context that the engine binds to canonical order state; and accepted-but-not-completed means durable pending work, never a possible drop.
- Order-entry APIs, market-data/history APIs, account/bot ledgers, settlement, and analytics are separate planes. See [`TRADING_MARKET_DATA_BOUNDARIES.md`](./TRADING_MARKET_DATA_BOUNDARIES.md).
- Product-facing surfaces are limited to venue intake/trading information and admin/data. Raw `/internal/*` HTTP routes are local/migration tooling only and must not be exposed as public, partner, bot, SDK, or stable operator contracts. See [`API_SURFACE_POLICY.md`](./API_SURFACE_POLICY.md) and D-048.
- Current boundary hardening checkpoint: hosted public admin/data uses `/admin/v1/...` gateway routes, raw `/internal/*` HTTP is controlled by `PLATFORM_INTERNAL_HTTP_MODE`, non-local boundary defaults fail closed unless auth/rate-limit/durable-idempotency/internal-exposure modes are explicit, admin HTTP actor identity is principal/header-bound rather than body/query-bound, command/order/market-data reads pass through read boundary checks, and `/healthz` plus `/readyz` are distinct runtime surfaces.

Current decision anchors:

- D-036 and D-037 define durable stream-backed acceptance and completion semantics.
- D-040 supersedes generic unary worker-to-engine calls for the hot matching path.
- D-041 makes Kafka-compatible durable producer plus matching-engine direct consumer the active hot-ingress target, with JetStream retained as fallback/comparison.
- D-043 makes venue event batch materialization the next persistence boundary: event batches are the durable matching handoff, and Postgres materializer offsets commit only after compact canonical rows commit.
- D-047 defines the current command intake process: public `202` responses expose stable command references, provider details stay diagnostic, idempotency scopes by `clientId + route + idempotencyKey`, and canonical materialization closes accepted-command accounting after drain.
- D-048 defines the internal interface and external surface hardline: internal service/control capabilities default to gRPC/protobuf or durable messaging, while externally reachable admin/data capabilities must be gateway-backed, authenticated, authorized, audited, and versioned.
- D-049 remains the boundary-hardening decision; the [September implementation audit](./archive/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS_AUDIT_2026-09-04.md) narrows its remaining work. Order/command scope checks, durable run/session/instrument partitioning, TLS/mesh client modes, standard engine gRPC health, and role-aware readiness are implemented. Remaining work is settlement run-read visibility/enforcement, peer/service identity proof, and operational readiness beyond configuration flags. The [`INTERNAL_HTTP_CALLER_INVENTORY.md`](./INTERNAL_HTTP_CALLER_INVENTORY.md) has no hosted migration candidate; containment remains a regression rule.
- D-050 keeps one post-trade domain model with policy/timing profiles (`ops-realistic-v1` industry-baseline default, `instant-post-trade-v1` for simulator/game runs) rather than separate settlement models; see [`SETTLEMENT_CLEARING_STRATEGY.md`](./SETTLEMENT_CLEARING_STRATEGY.md).
- D-051 makes GitHub the first human identity provider for Bot Arena, keyed by GitHub's immutable numeric user id; see [`BOT_ARENA_AUTH_AND_PROVISIONING.md`](./archive/BOT_ARENA_AUTH_AND_PROVISIONING.md).
- D-052 defines the Bot Arena admin UI (`apps/arena-admin`, SvelteKit static, deployed behind Caddy on the backbone host): public landing/leaderboard pages plus a GitHub-OAuth-gated admin area. Public leaderboard reads land under the venue-intake `/api/v1/...` family, not `/admin/v1/...`; game types move from a free-form `mode_id` string to a seeded `arena.game_modes` reference table with a `mandatory` flag, with per-bot opt-out deferred past v1.
- D-053 makes Reef/Arena separation a build and deployment invariant: Reef must build, test, start, and run without Arena code or infrastructure; Arena depends on Reef contracts through an Arena-owned artifact/overlay; feature flags and JVM tree shaking are not the opt-out mechanism. The prerequisite is promoted with the evidence in [`REEF_BOT_ARENA_SEPARATION_PROMOTION.md`](./archive/REEF_BOT_ARENA_SEPARATION_PROMOTION.md); invite-preview implementation is underway.
- Stream command envelope and direct-processor tests prove submit, cancel, and modify commands for the same `runId + venueSessionId + instrumentId` share the same partition lane. Stream-ack HTTP boundary tests prove lifecycle commands missing hot-path routing or ownership metadata are rejected before intake reservation or durable publish, and engine tests prove mismatched context cannot mutate the target order.
- Local 2026-07-04 evidence shows the venue event batch materializer can keep compact canonical Postgres storage correct under mixed submit/modify/cancel direct-stream load at `5k rps` and `10k rps` for `3m`; see [`PERSISTENCE_MATERIALIZER_TEST_RESULTS_2026-07-04.md`](./archive/PERSISTENCE_MATERIALIZER_TEST_RESULTS_2026-07-04.md).
- The first persistence-layer test gate after materialization projects `SubmitOrder`, `ModifyOrder`, and `CancelOrder` lifecycle outcomes from `runtime.canonical_command_outcomes` into `submit_results`, `runtime_events`, and accepted submit `orders`. No-DB direct-consume batches carry the compact `acceptedOrder` projection fact; `command_log.command_payloads` is a fallback for older or command-log-backed batches.
- Local replay/check tooling now verifies stored venue event batch payload replay is idempotent and compares command counts, payload checksums, command outcome payload hashes, stream gaps/overlaps, and optional projection watermarks with `make dev-venue-event-replay-check`.
- Local 2026-07-08 crash-gate evidence shows the durable direct path survives engine restart/backlog, engine event-batch publish failure before command offset commit, engine ack failure after durable event-batch publication, materializer ack failure after canonical commit, projector failure after rows before watermark, all four direct-stream partitions, and replay/checksum verification with no gaps or duplicate inserts. API publish-marker recovery is covered by HTTP-path tests that retry after durable publish ack but before the boundary marker update, republish, converge the marker, and avoid further republish on replay; see [`DURABLE_DIRECT_CRASH_GATE_RESULTS_2026-07-08.md`](./archive/DURABLE_DIRECT_CRASH_GATE_RESULTS_2026-07-08.md).
- DigitalOcean 2026-07-12 c-16 evidence shows the Redpanda direct-stream plus venue-event-materializer path can hold the `soak-5m` `10k` gate across two `5m` samples with `100%` success, zero accepted/direct-acked/materialized gaps, zero materializer lag, average accepted/materialized throughput `9999.68/sec`, average p95 `28.25ms`, and average p99 `57.21ms`. The local artifact directory is `reports/do-benchmark/do-benchmark-20260712T143401Z/`; see [`DIGITALOCEAN_STRESS_TEST_PLAN.md`](./archive/DIGITALOCEAN_STRESS_TEST_PLAN.md) and [`PERFORMANCE_LEARNINGS.md`](./PERFORMANCE_LEARNINGS.md). This proves canonical materializer capacity for the venue-core profile; projections/read-model freshness remain the next separate gate because this run intentionally left `projected=0`.
- July 19 transactional hardening and corrected local `10k` diagnostics are complete and intentionally paused before a `20k` claim. The corrected warm `15m` run closed `8,999,955` accepted/published/acked/materialized commands at `9,999.49/sec` with zero failures/final lag, while exposing bounded price-level cardinality, unbounded live-order growth under the `68/24/8` mix, and roughly `2,147` WAL bytes/command. Resume with the bounded-working-set/state-shape gate, then the compact canonical storage A/B; see [`THROUGHPUT_SCALING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](./THROUGHPUT_SCALING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#pause--resume-handoff).
- DigitalOcean 2026-07-12 short projection evidence showed the projection path could catch up cleanly at `2.5k rps` on c-16 after splitting four projector instances across active direct-stream partitions `0-15`: run `do-benchmark-20260712T172412Z` accepted/materialized/projected `149,976` commands, projected rps `2499.56`, p95 `35.98ms`, p99 `82.06ms`, projection lag `0`, materialized/projected gap `0`, and projection Postgres deadlocks `0`.
- DigitalOcean 2026-07-16 named projection freshness gate passed on c-16 with Redpanda direct-stream plus venue-event materializer and venue/order-lifecycle/market-data projectors enabled: run `do-benchmark-20260716T005756Z` accepted/direct-acked/materialized/projected `150,001` commands, throughput `2499.52/sec`, p95 `47.31ms`, p99 `159.32ms`, projection lag `0`, accepted/materialized gap `0`, materialized/projected gap `0`, and `100%` success. Artifacts live under `reports/do-benchmark/do-benchmark-20260716T005756Z/`. This closes the named short projection freshness gate; it is still separate from the `10k` venue-core materializer baseline and is not a UI/control-room capacity claim.
- DigitalOcean 2026-07-17 projection pressure evidence found the read-model knee and validated the first projection-stage fixes. The corrected short gate run `do-benchmark-20260717T014839Z` passed at `2.5k rps` with `149,975` attempted/accepted/direct-acked/materialized/projected, lag `0`, gaps `0`, p95 `31.31ms`, and p99 `79.38ms`. A `5k rps` pressure run before SQL ordering (`do-benchmark-20260717T015658Z`) showed venue-core held `299,950` accepted/direct-acked/materialized with p95 `67.57ms` and p99 `138.57ms`, but projection ended with a `1,834` materialized/projected gap, one projector failure, one projection-postgres deadlock inside `runtime.runtime_persist_submit_outcomes`, and `~2.03GB` projection WAL. After ordering `runtime_events` inserts by `event_id`, the comparable full-projection run `do-benchmark-20260717T020807Z` removed the deadlock and count gap (`299,952` accepted/direct-acked/materialized/projected, deadlocks `0`) but still ended with watermark lag `1,367`, concentrated in partitions `8-11`, and projection-postgres still wrote about `2.01GB` WAL, `2.05M` inserted tuples, `47k` updated tuples, and `5.03GB` temp bytes. After splitting the projection function and fixing Docker Compose env pass-through for `STREAM_ACK_PROJECTION_STAGE`, `do-benchmark-20260717T131344Z` proved the `command-status` write-stage ablation could keep up at `5k`: `299,955` attempted/accepted/direct-acked/materialized/projected, lag `0`, gaps `0`, p95 `74.49ms`, p99 `112.93ms`, projector failures/retries/deadlocks `0`, and no `runtime_events`/trace-sequence row growth. It did not prove standalone cancel/reject/modify lifecycle freshness because that derivation depends on timeline-written events. After deterministic timeline sequencing removed the trace allocator from new canonical payloads, `do-benchmark-20260717T134058Z` proved full-projection freshness at `5k`: `299,804` attempted/accepted/direct-acked/materialized/projected, lag `0`, gaps `0`, p95 `71.89ms`, p99 `112.89ms`, projector failures/retries/deadlocks `0`, about `1.94GB` projection WAL, `1.75M` inserted tuples, `47k` updated tuples, and `5.59GB` temp bytes. The takeaway is explicit: venue-core and full projection can catch up at `5k/60s`, while command-status is useful only as a diagnostic write-stage ablation until its lifecycle dependency is redesigned; the next bottleneck is lowering projection write amplification before longer `5k` soaks or higher rates. See [`PROJECTION_THROUGHPUT_SCALING_PLAN.md`](./PROJECTION_THROUGHPUT_SCALING_PLAN.md).
- The August 20 sustained rerun established the current promotion boundary: `do-benchmark-20260820T220557Z` kept full projection fresh at `2.5k/5m` (`749,976` accepted/materialized/projected, zero lag), while `do-benchmark-20260820T222945Z` accepted and materialized `1,500,002` at `5k/5m` but projected only `746,047`, leaving `757,955` watermark lag with no projector failures, retries, or deadlocks. Gate 0 now protects the unsafe status/lifecycle ablation, captures projector phase/batch/pool telemetry, and supplies a fixed-backlog drain harness. An isolated all-maintainer run drained an observed `52,250` items at `3,929.46/s`; the follow-up one-maintainer topology projected `100,002` fixed outcomes within `10.383s` of container start (a conservative `>=9,631.32/s` local bound) with correct final rows, empty dirty queues, and no failures/retries/deadlocks. Nested statement evidence ranks the status stage above timeline in this local shape and identifies repeated exact `submit_results` counts as a scan source. The named remote gate selects one lifecycle/market-data maintainer and requires `pg_stat_statements` plus I/O/WAL-I/O artifacts. Recovered August 21 remote short runs used that topology and instrumentation: `2.5k/60s` passes the current checker; `5k/60s` reaches `299,959` exact stage counts and zero canonical-projector lag but fails final lifecycle/market maintainer drain checks (`500`/`32` processed rows). The next step is that downstream drain gap, then bounded experiments and sustained promotion; see the [audited evidence](./archive/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS_AUDIT_2026-09-04.md#recovered-august-21-projection-evidence).
- Kafka-compatible command publish now performs one application send and relies on Kafka's idempotent producer for broker-level retries, avoiding a second application-layer resend path. The `202 Accepted` contract is unchanged: responses still require durable producer acknowledgement before acceptance.
- Redpanda engine processing now uses one transactional producer per partition lane: event batch and highest contiguous command offset commit atomically; abort rolls back in-memory mutations; an ambiguous commit fails the shard closed. Materializers use `read_committed`. A broker-backed Redpanda test proves commit, abort invisibility, retry, static-owner replacement fencing, full-log restart recovery, and matching-state checksum equality. Durable snapshots and routing-epoch handoff remain required before live dynamic migration or bounded-time recovery from very large logs.
- `/api/v1/commands/{commandId}` now exposes the provider-neutral public status vocabulary from `COMMAND_INTAKE_PROCESS.md`: stream/captured pending commands report `ACCEPTED`, worker-draining commands report `IN_FLIGHT`, canonical accepted outcomes report `COMPLETED`, canonical business rejects report `REJECTED`, and failure outcomes report `FAILED`. The legacy queue state remains available as diagnostic `internalStatus`.
- Account/bot risk pre-checks now have a boundary contract and allow-all/static implementation that can reject, backpressure, or disable bots before command-log append, stream intake reservation, or durable publish.
- Market-data reads have a first conservative projection-backed slice: `runtime.order_lifecycle_state` tracks open/partially-filled/filled/cancelled/rejected order state, `runtime.market_data_snapshots` reads remaining open `LIMIT` quantity for `/api/v1/market-data/snapshots/{instrumentId}`, and `/api/v1/market-data/depth/{instrumentId}` exposes bounded lifecycle-backed depth. The opt-in `MARKET_DATA_PROJECTOR_ENABLED=true` loop keeps top-of-book snapshots current and reports status at `/internal/market-data/projector/status`. Maintenance is incremental, mirroring the order-lifecycle projector: it first advances `runtime.order_lifecycle_state` from `runtime.order_lifecycle_dirty`, which marks each touched order's instrument in `runtime.market_data_snapshot_dirty`, then `runtime.runtime_project_market_data_snapshots(...)` recomputes top-of-book for only those instruments, bounded by `MARKET_DATA_PROJECTOR_BATCH_SIZE`; instruments whose last open order leaves the book get their snapshot row removed instead of left stale.
- `/api/v1/market-data/trades/{instrumentId}` exposes a public trade tape (price, quantity, currency, occurredAt, tradeId, and a monotonic `sequence` cursor), most-recent-first, bounded by `limit` (max 500) with `before=<sequence>` pagination. Deliberately excludes counterparty/order/participant identity, matching `docs/BOT_ARENA_PLAN.md`'s visible-data policy ("public top-of-book, limited depth, or last-trade data"). Reads `runtime.trades` directly — no projector, no lag, since trade facts are already durable and idempotently written by the existing submit-outcome persist functions. Trade tape, intraday bars, and own-order reads now include a small `meta` block declaring their source and freshness model.
- `runtime.order_lifecycle_state` is kept live by its own opt-in `ORDER_LIFECYCLE_PROJECTOR_ENABLED=true` background loop (status at `/internal/order-lifecycle/projector/status`), rather than only through the manual/admin rebuild endpoint. Maintenance is incremental: every write that touches `orders`/`executions`/`trades`/`runtime_events` marks affected order_ids in `runtime.order_lifecycle_dirty`, and each cycle recomputes only those, bounded by `ORDER_LIFECYCLE_PROJECTOR_BATCH_SIZE`. The old full-table rebuild stays available as a manual/admin repair tool. Genuine engine-level `SubmitOrder` rejects (not boundary rejects like `AUTHORIZATION_ERROR`/`REFERENCE_DATA_ERROR`) now get an `orders` row and a `REJECTED` lifecycle status instead of being visible only through `submit_results`.
- `/api/v1/market-data/bars/{instrumentId}` exposes intraday OHLCV bars (`interval` one of `1m`/`5m`/`15m`/`1h`, `start`/`end` bounds) aggregated from `runtime.trades` via Postgres `date_bin`, matching the Bot SDK's `BotHistoricalBarsRequestV1`/`HistoricalBarV1` contract exactly. `/api/v1/orders/current` and `/api/v1/orders/history` expose participant-scoped own-order reads (joining `runtime.orders` and `runtime.order_lifecycle_state`), closing the previous "no scoped orders query" gap — the only prior order read was an unscoped all-participants dump. Own-order reads now accept optional `instrumentId` and `limit` query parameters so bot/user history reads can stay bounded. `/api/v1/data/availability` now inventories these bot/user data surfaces with endpoint, source, freshness model, visibility scope, required/optional filters, and projection lag/watermark where available, so tests can state whether they prove durable facts, projection freshness, or only command completion.
- `packages/bot-sdk/src/live-client.ts` adds live-read wiring in the Bot SDK: `createLiveMarketDataClientV1`, `createLiveHistoricalDataClientV1`, `createLiveOwnOrdersReadClientV1`, and `createLiveBotContextV1` call the endpoints above over real HTTP and now carry the required client identity, optional authorization, and participant scope. `runner.ts`, `strategy-runner.ts`, and `hosted-runner.ts` accept opt-in `readClients`, so fixture mode remains the default while live smoke and hosted artifact runs can read market data, bars, and own orders from platform projections. Hosted reports include `readMode` and, in live read mode, `dataAvailability`. Prices are stored venue-wide as fixed-point nanos (`contracts/proto/order_execution.proto`'s `Price.nanos`, `price_nanos = price_dollars * 1e9`); live reads divide by that scale before returning `number` fields to bot code, and the venue adapter converts bot `limitPrice` values back to nanos before submitting commands.
- Bot Arena Phase 1 has local positive and negative persisted gates. The positive `make dev-smoke-bot-arena-local-persist` gate now requires a pre-locked admission window/roster, verifies zero-fee competition/house reconciliation, runs through `/api/v1`, waits for projection drain, then persists run results and leaderboard evidence through loopback-only admin routes. `make dev-smoke-bot-arena-local-negative` retains the deterministic freeze/disqualification path. Historical evidence predates the new roster/reconciliation requirement and must not be treated as proof of that new gate; record a fresh bound run before release.
- Bot Arena score-v1 now has local reset-to-reset proof and hosted DigitalOcean `15m` hardening evidence. Local 2026-07-14 evidence proved deterministic score/accounting equality across two clean `5m` runs. Hosted run `do-benchmark-20260714T010045Z` passed the arena artifact gate with `6985` submitted commands, `6985` terminal `COMPLETED`, accounting gap `0`, timeouts/rejects/freezes `0`, health `pass`, projection lag `0`, `2010` fills, and public score-v1 mismatch count `0`; artifacts live under `reports/do-benchmark/do-benchmark-20260714T010045Z/`. Remaining arena cleanup is hosted pacing lag: the `900s` schedule took `1017s` on the c-8 source-built worker with final completion lag near `107s`; track this as performance cleanup, not scoring correctness.
- Post-trade is in the focused lifecycle sprint now that P1/P2 scenario locks and direct-stream replay evidence exist. The current implementation has instant-post-trade obligation materialization, allocation/confirmation/affirmation facts, clearing submission/acceptance, novation, instructions, attempts, cash/security leg outcomes, append-only ledger proof, repair commands, proof/score reads, and an exception queue projection over clearing rejections and settlement breaks. The next work is not a broad clearinghouse build; it is [`POST_TRADE_LIFECYCLE_SPRINT.md`](./POST_TRADE_LIFECYCLE_SPRINT.md): add remaining scenario evidence and operator workflow hardening while keeping Bot Arena as a consumer rather than the owner of settlement semantics.

## Current Forward Path

Order-mutation/replay/protobuf hardening landed in PR #337, projection evidence
and stress-harness hardening in PR #341, and CI reliability in PR #349. See
[`WORK_PLAN.md`](./WORK_PLAN.md#recent-implementation-checkpoint) for the code
checkpoint and [`CI_OPERATIONS.md`](./CI_OPERATIONS.md) for ongoing CI gates.

This is orientation for the single active execution ladder in
[`WORK_PLAN.md`](./WORK_PLAN.md#active-execution-ladder), not a second plan.
The current order is:

1. Complete remaining invite-only game-preview evidence: promoted hosted Arena
   rehearsal, multi-seed policy evidence, and a labelled leaderboard run.
   External-account admission/onboarding is already complete.
2. Continue API/control-plane hardening from the implemented order/command
   scope checks, TLS/mesh options, and role-aware readiness. Next code slice is
   settlement run-read visibility/enforcement in both HTTP adapters, as scoped
   in `WORK_PLAN.md`.
3. Resume venue-core scaling only from the recorded pause handoff, beginning
   with reconciliation of the unmerged state-shape branch, then bounded
   working-set and compact canonical storage gates.
4. Reduce projection write amplification from the `2.5k/5m` sustained baseline:
   reuse the completed August 21 one-maintainer short comparison, close its
   `5k` downstream-drain gap, then pursue sustained promotion.
5. Record the remaining post-trade scenario/operator evidence now that the
   clearing/novation and exception-queue slices are implemented.
6. Keep docs synchronized and archive superseded planning without deleting
   decision, benchmark, security, or replay evidence.

Detailed evidence and acceptance criteria live in the linked source documents
above and in [`WORK_PLAN.md`](./WORK_PLAN.md); they should not be copied back
into this summary.

## Documentation Map

Use the [documentation map](README.md) for current entry points and the
[archive index](archive/README.md) for dated evidence. This snapshot's
September 4 links remain valid evidence, but their inclusion does not make
older sprint plans or benchmark results active instructions.

## Cleanup Policy

Do not delete benchmark reports or decision records just because they are superseded. They explain why the current path changed.

Slim planning docs by:

- keeping one current execution ladder
- marking historical sprint plans as historical when they are superseded
- moving repeated benchmark interpretation into `PERFORMANCE_LEARNINGS.md`
- linking evidence instead of duplicating long run summaries in multiple plans
